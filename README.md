# Automated OMR Evaluation System

An intelligent, end-to-end solution for automated evaluation of Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) answer sheets with advanced image processing, real-time scoring, and comprehensive result analytics.

## 🎯 Overview

This system streamlines the OMR evaluation process by automatically processing scanned answer sheets, detecting filled bubbles, matching against answer keys, and generating detailed performance reports. Built with modern web technologies and computer vision algorithms, it provides a seamless experience for educators and institutions.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔧 Core Functionality

- **Accurate Bubble Detection**: Advanced threshold-based detection with fill ratio analysis
- **Multi-Subject Scoring**: Support for 5 subjects with 20 questions each (100 total)
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Instant scoring with comprehensive result generation
- **Quality Assurance**: Automatic flagging of ambiguous or unmarked responses

### 📊 Analytics & Reporting
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time statistics with subject-wise performance analysis
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV/Excel export with detailed breakdowns
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of corrections and modifications
- **Visual Overlays**: Processed sheet visualization for transparency

### 🔍 Review & Correction
